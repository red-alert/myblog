# myblog
This git is for my personal photograph blog.
Currently it's based on MongoDB, Flask, Bootstrap3.

The main functions in the blog are:
  1. Display photos I shot during past years.
  2. Pictures will be sorted according to it's shot time.
  3. I should be able to upload my photos and have a little story along with each one of them.
  4. The photos need to be reasonably sized.
  5  The frontend need to be self adaptive thus supporting multiple devices and web browsers.
  6. It uses mongoDB to store user infos and photo infos.
  7. In early age photos are stored in static folder, but later will be stored in some cheap object store.
  8. It needs to look awesome.
